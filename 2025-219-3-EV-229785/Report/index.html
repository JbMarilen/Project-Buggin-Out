            <h2>Meeting The Brief</h2>
            
            <h3>Basic Requirement 1: Collect and Prepare the Data</h3>
            <p>I selected the World Happiness Dataset from Kaggle (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness/data"><i>link</i></a>). The datasets contain years (2015-2019) of happiness scores across different countries, alongside economic, societal, health, freedom, generosity, and corruption factors.</p>
            <p>I used <b>Python</b> to extract, clean, and store the data. The cleaning process involved:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dropping unnecessary columns</li>
                <li>Renaming columns</li>
                <li>Storing cleaned data to new CSV files (new_{year}.csv)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This process was necessary to ensure that each dataset was consistent throughout. I ensured that each dataset contained the same columns, removing unnecessary data for visualisation. Evidence of this below:</p>
            <img width="1075" height="600" src="https://imengine.public.prod.cmg.infomaker.io/?uuid=2468dde6-d0e3-5b9a-91a0-8d49d61fe5fe&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.84375&x=0&y=0&width=1200&height=675">
          
            <h3>Basic Requirement 2: Data Analytics and Visualisation</h3>
            <p>Using <b>Python</b>, I conducted data analytics and generated four different types of visualisations:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Bar Charts (leaderboard):</b> Displays the top 10 happiest countries in each respective dataset.</li>
                <li><b>Histograms:</b> Displays the differences between the least and happiest countries in each respective dataset.</li>
                <li><b>Scatterplots:</b> Displays the correlation on how different factors contribute to overall happiness scores.</li>
                <li><b>Line Graphs:</b> Displays the factors throughout the years of three countries. These three countries are the most recurring countries in the Top 3 of each year.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>All visualisations include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Titles and axis labels for clarity</li>
                <li>Legends where appropriate</li>
                <li>Properly formatted data points</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These visualisations were created using <b>Pygal</b>, a Python visualisation library, ensuring clear representation of key dataset aspects.</p>

            <h3>Basic Requirement 3: Create a Basic Interactive Information System Interface.</h3>
            <p>My website:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provides an overview of the dataset</li>
                <li>Displays the <b>bar charts</b>, <b>histograms</b>, <b>scatterplots</b>, and <b>line graphs</b> generated</li>
                <li>Allows users to interact with my website</li>
                <li>Form for user submission</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The website was built using <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>JavaScript</b>.</p>

            <h3>Advanced Requirement 1: Interactive Data Visualisations</h3>
            <p>The visualisations on the website are interactive with <b>Pygal</b>'s inbuilt functionality. Users can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hover over data points to see details</li>
                <li>Click on categories to filter specific information</li>
                <li>Adjust date ranges to focus on particular years</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Advanced Requiremnt 2: User Input Form</h3>
            <p>A form was created in form.js to collect user feedback on their own happiness in relation to their country and factors.</p>
            <p>The form collects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>String data (Country, Age, Comments, Email)</li>
                <li>Integer data (Happiness Rating (1-10))</li>
                <li>Boolean data (Checkbox Selection Factors)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The process of the form is as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Validates inputs before submission via <b>HTML</b> <i>(required Attribute)</i></li>
                <li>Stores responses in a <b>PouchDB</b> database</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This collected data is summarised and displayed dynamically on the website in the Data Analytics section.</p>

            <h3>Advanced Requirement 3: Reccomendations</h3>
            <p>The website includes a <b>Recommendations section</b>, providing insights based on the analysed dataset. These recommendations help users understand trends and make informal decisions based on their happiness score and influencing factors.</p>

                <li><b>Interactivity and User Engagement:</b> Users can hover over charts to see details, filter data dynamically, and submit their own happiness-related data via a form. The system updates the dynamic visualisations in real time based on user inputs.</li>
                <li><b>Reccomendations Section:</b> The systems provides personalised recommendations based on user-submitted data, comparing it with global averages to suggest potential improvements.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Potential Improvements</h3>
            <p><b>Enhanced User Experience (UX)</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The current visualisations are effective but could be improved with more interactive features like animated transsitions and tooltips for deeper insights.</li>
                <li>A searchable map could provide geographical context to happiness scores</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Machine Learning for Advanced Analysis</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A future version could incorporate machine learning models to predict happiness trends based on historical data and other factors.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Expanded Data Collection</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The system currently relies on a dataset from Kaggle. Future improvements could allow users to upload their own datasets for custom analysis</li>
                <li>A real-time API can enhance dataset's relevance.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>User Engagement and Accessibility</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensuring full mobile responsiveness would improve accessibility across all devices.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Expanding Coding Proficiency</h3>
            <p>The Leaving Certificate course exceedingly sufficient to satisfy my needs in creating my interactive information system. Therefore, weeks of research and learning was necessary to complete my project. I was already extremely experienced in HTML and CSS. At times, research was needed for my python scripts to help create my scripts. JavaScript research was especially needed as my level of Javascript was not sufficient enough to complete my interactive system.</p>
